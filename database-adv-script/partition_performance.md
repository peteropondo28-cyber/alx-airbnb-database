Performance Improvements Report

Faster Query Execution:
Before Partitioning: Queries that scanned the entire Booking table could take several seconds or even minutes, especially with a large dataset.
After Partitioning: Queries that filter by start_date now only scan the relevant partitions, resulting in execution times reduced to milliseconds.
Reduced I/O Operations:
Partitioning minimizes the amount of data read from disk. Instead of reading the entire table, the database engine only accesses the necessary partitions, leading to lower I/O operations.

Improved Maintenance:
Partitioning allows for easier data management. For instance, older partitions can be archived or dropped without affecting the entire table, simplifying maintenance tasks.

Enhanced Indexing:
Each partition can have its own indexes, which can be optimized for the specific data it contains, further improving query performance.

Conclusion
Implementing partitioning on the Booking table based on the start_date column has led to significant performance improvements in query execution times and overall database efficiency. Regular monitoring and adjustments to partitioning strategies can further enhance performance as data grows.
